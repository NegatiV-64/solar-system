                    than
                    99.8% of the total mass of the Solar System.

                    The Sun is, at present, about 70% hydrogen and 28% helium by mass everything else (“metals”) amounts
                    to
                    less than 2%. This changes slowly over time as the Sun converts hydrogen to helium in its core.

                    The outer layers of the Sun exhibit differential rotation: at the equator the surface rotates once
                    every
                    25.4 days; near the poles it’s as much as 36 days. This odd behavior is due to the fact that the Sun
                    is
                    not a solid body like the Earth.

                    the sun. However, Mercury’s orbit
                    is not a perfect circle. The planet can pass as close as 29 million miles and as far away as 43
                    million
                    miles.
                    Mercury is the fastest planet in the solar system, speeding along at about 29
                    miles per second and completing each orbit around the sun in just 88 Earth days. Mercury is also the
                    smallest planet in the solar system, measuring just 3,032 miles wide at its equator. That makes it
                    only
                    slightly larger than Earth’s moon.

                    hottest of the eight worlds in our solar system. Its thick atmosphere is mostly made of carbon
                    dioxide
                    with clouds of sulfuric acid, which creates a greenhouse effect.

                    Thanks to this blanket, temperatures on Venus' surface can soar over 880 degrees
                    Fahrenheit. The surface pressure is around 90 times that on Earth, which would
                    feel like standing under about a half a mile of water. Wintertime doesn't even provide a reprieve
                    from
                    the heat. With an axial tilt of three degrees, Venus has just one season: hot.

                    only one known for sure to have liquid water on its surface. Earth is also unique in terms of
                    monikers. Every other solar system planet was named for a Greek or Roman deity, but for at least a
                    thousand years, some cultures have described our world using the Germanic word “earth,” which means
                    simply “the ground.”

                    years ago, the fourth planet from the sun could have been mistaken for Earth’s smaller twin, with
                    liquid water on its surface—and maybe even life.

                    Now, the world is a cold, barren desert with few signs of liquid water. But after decades of study
                    using orbiters, landers, and rovers, scientists have revealed Mars as a dynamic, windblown landscape
                    that could—just maybe—harbor microbial life beneath its rusty surface even today.

                    "star-like" — orbit between Mars and Jupiter in a grouping known as the Main Asteroid Belt.

                    The Main Asteroid Belt lies more than two-and-a-half times as far as Earth does from the sun. It
                    contains millions of asteroids, according to NASA. Most of these are relatively small, from the size
                    of boulders to a few thousand feet in diameter. But some are significantly larger.

                    face of a striped giant.

                    Though seemingly serene when viewed from the relative safety of our home world, Jupiter is a chaotic
                    and stormy place. The gas giant planet's spots come from massive storms that whip up
                    prevailing winds as fast as 335 miles an hour at the equator—faster than any known winds on Earth.

                    in the equatorial region. (In contrast, the strongest hurricane-force winds on Earth top out at
                    about 360 feet, or 110 meters, per second.) These superfast winds, combined with heat rising from
                    within the planet's interior, cause the yellow and gold bands visible in the atmosphere.

                    Saturn's ring system is the most extensive and complex in the solar system, extending hundreds of
                    thousands of kilometers from the planet.

                    moons to the fact that it may even rain diamonds from its hazy atmosphere.

                    Like Saturn, Jupiter, and Neptune, Uranus is a big ball of gas, often called a jovian or gas giant
                    world. Uranus owes its vibrant blue-green hues not from unusual oceans but from an upper atmosphere
